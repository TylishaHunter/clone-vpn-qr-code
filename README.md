***So you have probably seen the Clone VPN partner codes, well I did too, and there was something strange about them...***

*The first 2 letters were always odd and rather random. For example: JG, VG, cd, lz, and Fp were in those partner codes*

A new button in clonevpn.com website has appeared, when clicked on it, it will be directed to this QR code with the time telling when clicked on the QR code or scanned, it will be redirected to a YouTube, scroll down more and you will see a bunch of shapes, and a quote from Genesis 3:19 "For dust you are and to dust you shall return", and scroll down until the end, you will see a smiley, sort of distorted face that appeared in the video titled clonevpn.mp4

Another thing is Johnny RaZeR isnt dead apart from his clone shotted him multiple times, he has been saved by the ball in his chest, saving him, he made a YT short about him telling this. The person who still isn't being affected (denied the contract) are Joe Caine, Mogswamp, and knsplash.

I also suspect that clones can't kill their own owners (despite Johnny RaZeR's clone attempt on killing him) because it would disrupt the clones, we actually see this because RoyalPear's video titled "[TITLE NOT GENERATED]", in the end a morse code was heard and said "I AM ALIVE", same thing in Bundun who has been held at gunpoint, and Riggy...well, he's not dead yet, as we know of

In also of their sponsorships (Danno/Riggy, Johnny, Bundun, and RoyalPear), they also say the exact words that Danno said in their shorts to promote CloneVPN with the title "my very important message (or etc)"

## CODES ARE (listed by the accordance to the numbers at the end of their codes):
